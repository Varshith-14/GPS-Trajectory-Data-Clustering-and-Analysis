# GPS-Trajectory-Data-Clustering-and-Analysis
The widespread use of smartphones has sped up the research on mobility by 
significantly expanding the types and amount of data that are available. GPS 
technology is one such source of mobility information, which is becoming more 
widely used and common in understanding human mobility patterns by the 
research community. However, there is no standard framework for using machine 
learning methods to study the various mobility patterns created by non-work and 
non-home locations of working and nonworking users on workdays and off days. 
In order to produce characteristics for each user along with Origin-Destination 
matrix features, a new mobility measure, Daily Characteristic Distance, is 
proposed. Then an unsupervised machine learning method called "k-means 
clustering" is used to obtain three user clusters for each type of day (workday and 
off day). The user commonality and average frequency metrics are the two new 
metrics that can be suggested for analysing the clustering results. Using the 
proposed metrics, user behaviours can be identified, and a better understanding 
of users' mobility patterns can be achieved.
